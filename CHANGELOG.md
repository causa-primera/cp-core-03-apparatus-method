# CHANGELOG.md

# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
- TBD

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-02-15
### Added
- `EN/TESTS.en.md` — conceptual tests (T1–T6) with explicit pass/fail criteria tied to invariants I1–I6.
- Strengthened auditability surfaces for apparatus compliance (testable conditions and failure signals).

### Changed
- `EN/GLOSSARY.en.md` expanded to 22 terms (G1–G22), including boundary notes to prevent category drift.
- `EN/ARGUMENT_MAP.en.md` expanded to a v0.3-level premise set (P1–P16) with explicit glossary linking and stronger support for invariants.
- `EN/OBJECTIONS.en.md` refined to contain apparatus-specific steelman objections (reducing duplication with Core-01 objections).

### Fixed
- `CITATION.cff` metadata corrected (title/repo identity for cp-core-03).
- `TRANSLATION_LOG.md` updated to explicitly list translated artifacts for Model B traceability.

### Notes
- Target: EEE Gate v0.3.0 (Core solidity). This release is intended to make the Apparatus Method auditable and gate-checkable.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-02-15
- Initial public structure (Model B: English release track + Spanish provenance snapshots).
