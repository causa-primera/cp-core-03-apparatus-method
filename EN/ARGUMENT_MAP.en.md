## Main claim (C)
**C:** A socio-technical system preserves strong agency only if it implements an apparatus that enforces non-delegability of commitment, genuine suspension, decision-boundary legibility, criteria traceability, and an answerability channel. (I1–I6)

## Premises
**P1.** Strong agency requires an interruptible sequence: Suspension → Evaluation → Commitment (S→E→K). (G1, G2, G3)  
**P2.** Instrumental systems (Second Causes) can generate outputs but cannot bear normative responsibility. (G6, G7)  
**P3.** Without explicit constraints, automation tends to (a) compress Suspension, (b) externalize Evaluation, and (c) simulate Commitment by default adoption. (G1, G8, G9)  
**P4.** If Suspension is compressed, the subject’s stance becomes automatic continuation rather than a controlled withholding. (G1, G8)  
**P5.** If Commitment is simulated by default adoption, responsibility attribution becomes ambiguous or displaced. (G3, G4, G7)  
**P6.** A decision can be responsibly owned only if the subject can appropriate it through Proof of Signature (PoS): boundary + criteria + consequences. (G4, G5, G10)  
**P7.** Appropriation requires minimally legible boundaries and traceable criteria; otherwise structured challenge is impossible. (G10, G11)  
**P8.** A system that enables structured challenge must include an answerability channel that can re-open S and E. (G12, I5)

## Inference steps
**S1.** From P1, P4: compressing S defeats strong agency.  
**S2.** From P2, P5: simulating K by automation defeats responsibility attribution.  
**S3.** From P6–P8: PoS + boundary legibility + criteria traceability + answerability channel are necessary conditions for responsible ownership.  
**S4.** Therefore, an apparatus must enforce invariants I1–I6 to preserve strong agency under automation. (C)
