# cp-core-03 — Argument Map (v0.3.0)

## Main conclusion (C)
**C:** A socio-technical system preserves strong agency and responsibility under automation only if it implements an apparatus that enforces invariants I1–I6 by preventing Second-Cause substitution through decision-boundary legibility, PoS, criteria traceability, contestability, and a defined signature topology. (G1–G4, G6–G15, G18–G20)

## Premises (numbered; glossary-linked)
**P1.** Responsibility attribution presupposes a distinction between instrumental outputs and owned commitments. (G7, G10, G18)  
**P2.** Owned commitment requires a responsibility-bearing locus (First Cause) that can be identified and held answerable. (G6, G12, G13)  
**P3.** In automated pipelines, default dynamics push toward automatic continuation and implicit adoption. (G17)  
**P4.** Automatic continuation compresses or nullifies genuine suspension at the decision boundary. (G8, G3, G17)  
**P5.** When suspension is compressed, outputs become commitments by default adoption (substitution). (G18, G10, G17)  
**P6.** Therefore, preserving responsibility requires an explicit decision boundary and boundary legibility (what was decided, alternatives, constraints). (G3, G4)  
**P7.** Boundary legibility is not merely descriptive; it is a control requirement that must be supported by interface constraints. (G4, G5)  
**P8.** Evaluation under automation is prone to externalization: criteria are displaced into instruments and become non-contestable. (G9, G16)  
**P9.** If operative criteria are not traceable, contestability collapses, and answerability becomes performative. (G15, G14, G12)  
**P10.** Therefore, the apparatus must enforce criteria traceability at the level of minimum viable reasons. (G15)  
**P11.** Preventing substitution requires an appropriation step: Proof of Signature (PoS) that ties boundary + reasons + answerability + revision channel. (G11, G3, G15, G12, G22)  
**P12.** PoS does not require full model interpretability; it requires that the responsible locus can appropriate and defend/revise commitments under challenge. (G11, G12, G14, G22)  
**P13.** In distributed systems, responsibility diffuses unless signature topology maps each boundary to an accountable signatory/committee. (G19, G6)  
**P14.** A governance layer can support enforcement, but cannot replace PoS without simulating ownership. (G20, G11)  
**P15.** Systems must include an answerability channel such that objections can re-open suspension/evaluation and force revision or explicit reaffirmation. (G12, G14, G22)  
**P16.** Emergency contexts require bounded exceptions; if emergency mode is not explicit and audited, it becomes a substitution loophole. (G21, G18)

## Inference steps
**S1.** From P1–P5: automation creates pressure toward substitution via default adoption. (G17, G18)  
**S2.** From P6–P12: boundary legibility + PoS + traceability are necessary to preserve ownership. (G3, G4, G11, G15)  
**S3.** From P13–P16: topology + answerability + bounded emergency modes prevent diffusion and loopholes. (G19, G12, G21)  
**S4.** Therefore C, and the apparatus must enforce invariants I1–I6.
