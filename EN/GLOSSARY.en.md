## G1 — Suspension (S)
Genuine withholding of commitment; not mere delay or friction. The capacity to stop automatic continuation.

## G2 — Evaluation (E)
Criterion-guided selection among reasons/grounds, including constraints, trade-offs, and uncertainty.

## G3 — Commitment / Normative Signature (K)
An attributable stance that can be owned, challenged, revised, and sanctioned.

## G4 — Answerability
The condition under which a subject can be required to respond to objections and consequences.

## G5 — Imputability
Normative assignability of a decision/action to a subject under a responsibility regime.

## G6 — First Cause
A responsibility-bearing subject capable of S→E→K as a controlled normative act.

## G7 — Second Cause
An instrumental transmissive process producing outputs without responsibility appropriation.

## G8 — Automatic continuation
A state where actions/decisions proceed by default, absent genuine suspension.

## G9 — Externalization (delegation boundary)
Delegation of evaluation/selection to instruments in a way that risks replacing First-Cause functions.

## G10 — Proof of Signature (PoS)
Procedural requirement that a commitment is owned: boundary + criteria + consequences + capacity for revision.

## G11 — Decision boundary
The explicit delineation of what was decided, what alternatives existed, and what constraints applied.

## G12 — Challenge channel
A defined mechanism to introduce objections that can re-open suspension/evaluation and force explicit reaffirmation or revision.
