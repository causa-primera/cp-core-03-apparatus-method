# cp-core-03 — Glossary (v0.3.0)

Use IDs (G1…G22) in `EN/ARGUMENT_MAP.en.md`, `EN/TESTS.en.md`, and other gate artifacts.

## G1 — Apparatus (method)
A reusable set of constraints, interfaces, and records that preserves responsible ownership under automation.

**Boundary note:** not a policy manual; it is a structural control layer.

## G2 — Apparatus method
A design discipline: enforce invariants that keep responsibility-bearing acts non-delegable while allowing instrumental assistance.

## G3 — Decision boundary
Explicit delineation of what is decided, alternatives, and constraints at the moment of commitment.

## G4 — Boundary legibility
The property that decision boundaries are identifiable, describable, and stable across stakeholders.

## G5 — Interface constraint
A requirement on how the system presents options, uncertainty, and refusal paths so that ownership remains possible.

## G6 — First Cause (normative locus)
A responsibility-bearing locus (person/role/committee) capable of owning commitments.

## G7 — Second Cause (instrumental)
A transmissive process generating outputs without ownership.

## G8 — Suspension (S)
Genuine withholding at the decision boundary.

**Not:** friction, delay, or a mere feeling of hesitation.

## G9 — Evaluation (E)
Criterion-guided selection among reasons/grounds under constraints and uncertainty.

## G10 — Commitment / Normative signature (K)
An attributable stance that can be owned, challenged, revised, and sanctioned.

## G11 — Proof of Signature (PoS)
Procedural appropriation step: boundary + minimum viable reasons + acceptance of answerability + revision channel.

**Not:** full model interpretability.

## G12 — Answerability
Standing to be required to respond to objections and consequences.

## G13 — Sanctionability
Possibility of attaching consequences to a responsible locus for a commitment (legal/professional/social).

## G14 — Contestability
Capacity for structured objections that can re-open suspension/evaluation and force explicit reaffirmation or revision.

## G15 — Criteria traceability (minimum viable reasons)
Ability to retrieve the operative criteria/grounds used at commitment time at a level sufficient for challenge.

## G16 — Externalization (delegation boundary)
Delegation that risks replacing First-Cause functions with instrumental outputs.

## G17 — Automatic continuation
Default/inertial mode where the process proceeds such that commitment is implied without explicit ownership.

## G18 — Second-Cause substitution
Treating instrumental outputs as if they were owned commitments.

## G19 — Signature topology
Mapping from decision boundaries to accountable signatories (roles/committees), preventing diffusion.

## G20 — Governance layer
Institutional scaffolding (oversight, audits, procedures) supporting accountability.

**Boundary note:** governance supports ownership but does not replace PoS.

## G21 — Emergency delegation mode
A bounded exception where speed forces partial delegation, compensated by explicit logging and post-hoc answerability.

## G22 — Revision / retraction
Controlled mechanism to change or withdraw commitments under defeat while preserving accountability.
