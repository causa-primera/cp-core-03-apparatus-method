# cp-core-03 — Steelman Objections (v0.3.0)

These objections target the Apparatus Method itself (not Core-01’s freedom thesis).

## O1 — Bureaucratization objection
The apparatus risks becoming a bureaucracy that substitutes paperwork for responsibility, producing formal compliance without genuine ownership.

## O2 — PoS gaming objection
Proof of Signature can be gamed: signatories may rubber-stamp, template reasons, or use boilerplate to simulate contestability.

## O3 — Boundary legibility impossibility objection
In real pipelines, decision boundaries are multi-layered and fluid. “What was decided” may be inherently ambiguous, making legibility requirements unrealistic.

## O4 — Traceability vs privacy/PII objection
Criteria traceability and logging may require recording sensitive information. The apparatus may conflict with privacy constraints or increase exposure risk.

## O5 — Contestability as attack surface objection
Challenge channels can become vectors for harassment, adversarial manipulation, or strategic obstruction, undermining operational stability.

## O6 — Signature topology diffusion objection
Even with topology mapping, organizations can diffuse responsibility by creating committees or rotating signatories, making accountability nominal.

## O7 — Emergency mode abuse objection
Emergency delegation modes can become the default operational mode, creating a permanent loophole that bypasses PoS.

## O8 — Governance displacement objection
The apparatus may merely shift responsibility into “governance compliance,” making responsibility a property of process owners rather than decision owners.

## O9 — Cross-domain mismatch objection
A single apparatus may not fit heterogeneous domains (law, medicine, finance). Domain-specific constraints may force incompatible apparatus variants.

## O10 — Instrumental superiority objection
Where instruments reliably outperform humans, insisting on PoS and suspension may increase harm by slowing action or increasing error rates.
