# cp-core-01 — Steelman Objections (v0.3.0)

These objections target Core-01’s claims about transcendental freedom as a condition for normative responsibility under automation.

## O1 — Proceduralization: normativity is smuggled in
Defining freedom as Suspension→Evaluation→Commitment (S→E→K) risks merely redescribing procedures while the actual source of normativity remains external (law, institutions, social practices). If so, “transcendental freedom” does not ground responsibility; it only packages it.

## O2 — Epiphenomenal suspension
Suspension may be psychologically salient yet normatively inert: decisions may still be determined by defaults, priors, environment, or pipeline inertia. If suspension cannot alter the decision boundary in a principled manner, it cannot underwrite responsibility.

## O3 — Collective agency: no single First Cause
Many decisions are structurally distributed across teams and infrastructures. If responsibility is inherently collective, insisting on a singular “First Cause” distorts the phenomenon and forces an individualistic signature onto organizational agency.

## O4 — Functional equivalence: anti-essentialism about agency
If two systems are functionally and behaviorally equivalent in all normatively relevant respects (including revision under challenge), denying agency to one looks like stipulation. Why isn’t “being a responsible subject” just a functional profile plus governance?

## O5 — Regress of endorsement
If commitment requires endorsement, what authorizes endorsement itself? Either there is an infinite regress (endorsement of endorsement…) or a brute stop (“the subject just owns it”), which risks becoming dogmatic.

## O6 — Criteria underdetermination: evaluation cannot be owned
Real-world criteria are often vague, conflicting, or post-hoc rationalized. If evaluation criteria cannot be specified ex ante, “owned evaluation” collapses into narrative reconstruction; responsibility becomes an after-the-fact story rather than a real normative act.

## O7 — Over-demandingness: the theory excludes ordinary agents
If responsible agency requires articulate criteria, structured suspension, and explicit commitment, then many ordinary actions (and many ordinary people under stress, low literacy, disability, or time pressure) fail the test. That yields an implausibly elitist account of responsibility.

## O8 — Normative pluralism: which norms does freedom commit to?
In plural societies, agents face incompatible normative regimes. If transcendental freedom is a condition of responsibility, how does it select which normativity binds? Without a selection principle, the framework may be indeterminate or politically biased.

## O9 — Reliability trade-off: responsibility constraints reduce welfare
In high-stakes settings, automated systems may outperform humans. Requiring strong suspension/PoS might slow action and increase errors. If the apparatus reduces welfare, why treat it as a universal constraint rather than a context-dependent luxury?

## O10 — Power and structural injustice: signatures can launder domination
If norms are shaped by power, then “signature” and “appropriation” may legitimate unjust structures (“you signed, so you own it”) while hiding coercion, dependency, or lack of alternatives. The framework risks moralizing compliance.
