# cp-core-01 — Responses to Steelman Objections (v0.3.0)

Paired responses to `OBJECTIONS.en.md` (O1–O10). The objective is boundary precision: what Core-01 establishes, what it delegates to Core-03 (apparatus constraints), and what it explicitly leaves open.

---

## R1 — Response to O1 (proceduralization / normativity smuggled in)
Core-01 does not claim to *generate* normativity. It claims that responsibility attribution presupposes a subject-position capable of (i) genuine withholding and (ii) attributable commitment under norms (whatever their source). Institutions can supply rules and sanctions; they cannot replace the logical role of owned commitment. Without a responsible subject-position, institutional procedures simulate responsibility rather than instantiate it.

## R2 — Response to O2 (epiphenomenal suspension)
Suspension is not a feeling; it is a control act at the decision boundary that can alter outcomes without extraordinary heroics. In mediated environments, genuine suspension depends on apparatus properties (Core-03): explicit stop/withhold channels, anti-default adoption, and re-opening evaluation. If those properties are absent, the system fails—Core-01 treats that as a real responsibility defect, not as evidence against the concept.

## R3 — Response to O3 (collective agency)
“First Cause” is a responsibility-bearing locus, not necessarily an individual. The framework supports collective agency via signature topology: roles/committees sign defined boundaries, and answerability channels route objections to the accountable locus. The target is not individualism but anti-diffusion: avoiding “everyone contributed, therefore no one answers.”

## R4 — Response to O4 (functional equivalence)
Core-01 avoids biological essentialism but rejects “output equivalence implies responsibility.” Responsibility requires a position in practices of attribution, contestation, sanctionability, and revision—i.e., a capacity for owned commitment, not merely behavior. A pipeline can mimic reason-responsiveness while remaining non-attributable (no legitimate demand for justification, no standing to accept sanctions, no recognized retraction). If governance must be imported to treat it “as if” responsible, that supports Core-02’s point: functional role alone is insufficient.

## R5 — Response to O5 (regress of endorsement)
The regress is blocked by treating commitment (K) as a basic normative act whose adequacy is assessed via answerability rather than infinite meta-endorsement. The subject must provide minimum operative reasons and accept structured challenge; ultimate foundations are not required. Revision/retraction under defeat replaces regress with a finite, auditable responsibility practice.

## R6 — Response to O6 (criteria underdetermination)
Core-01 requires **minimum viable reasons**, not complete ex ante formalization. Criteria can be partial, defeasible, and context-indexed, provided they are (a) operative at the time of commitment and (b) contestable afterward. The standard is not “perfect rationality,” but “non-arbitrary ownership”: the agent can state what counted as a reason/constraint and can revise when those grounds are defeated.

## R7 — Response to O7 (over-demandingness)
The framework is not a universal demand for high articulation; it is a **threshold account** that scales with stakes and institutional context. Everyday low-stakes action can satisfy responsibility with minimal PoS; high-stakes domains require stronger apparatus support (forms, review steps, sign-off roles). Importantly, the apparatus must reduce cognitive burden by making suspension and criteria capture easy and accessible—otherwise the system, not the person, is defective.

## R8 — Response to O8 (normative pluralism)
Core-01 is intentionally meta-normative at this stage: it specifies conditions for owning a stance under norms, not which norms are correct. Selection among regimes is a domain-level problem (politics/law/ethics). What Core-01 contributes is a constraint: whichever regime is invoked, the commitment must be attributable and answerable within a contestation structure, and the system must not treat mere pipeline outputs as normatively binding.

## R9 — Response to O9 (reliability trade-off)
Core-01 does not deny instrumental superiority. It denies that reliability substitutes for responsibility. In many settings, we can and should use high-performing instruments; the apparatus requirement is that a responsible locus remains identifiable and that adoption is not silent. In time-critical contexts, the apparatus can permit emergency delegation while preserving post-hoc answerability (explicit emergency mode, logged criteria, later review). Welfare gains and responsibility constraints are negotiated, not mutually exclusive.

## R10 — Response to O10 (power and structural injustice)
This objection is decisive as a design constraint: signature must not launder coercion. Therefore PoS must include **voluntariness/optionality checks** where relevant: whether meaningful alternatives existed, whether refusal was realistically possible, and whether the agent was acting under undue constraint. Domain repos (law/politics) will formalize these constraints; Core-01’s contribution is to insist that “ownership” requires a genuine decision boundary, not forced compliance dressed as commitment.
