Thesis (v0.1) — Transcendental Freedom
0. Status
Repository: cp-core-01-trascendental-freedom
Version: v0.1 (working thesis; definitions and tests are provisional)
Aim: to establish a transcendental claim: freedom is a condition of possibility for reason as such.
1. Central claim
Freedom is the condition of possibility of reason insofar as reason is normativity that can be owned (i.e., imputable commitments under reasons).
This is not an empirical thesis about performance or intelligence, but a structural thesis about what must be in place for reasoning to count as reasoning (as opposed to mere production of outputs).

2. What is meant here by “reason”
Reason (in the relevant sense) is the capacity to:

treat considerations as reasons (normative force, not mere causes),
evaluate under a criterion of correctness (even if revisable),
generate commitments that are imputable to a subject (a “signature” in the normative sense).
A system may produce correct or useful outputs without thereby instantiating reason in this strict sense. The question here is not usefulness, but normative status.

3. What is meant here by “freedom”
Freedom is not “unconstrained choice” nor “randomness.”
Freedom is the structural capacity to enact a three-moment act:

Suspension: interrupting automatic continuation; opening a space of alternatives (a real “can refrain / can withhold”).
Evaluation: selecting under an explicit or implicit criterion that purports to be correct (a “this is better/worse for a reason”).
Commitment: taking ownership of the selection as binding (a normative “signature”: I stand behind this; I can be asked to justify it; I can be held to it).
Thesis of this repository: without this three-moment structure, there is no reason in the strict sense—only output production.

4. The transcendental move (structure of the argument)
The argument proceeds by identifying what is presupposed by the practice of reasoning:

We (and our institutions) treat reasoning as something that can be correct/incorrect, justified/unjustified, and attributable.
These normative predicates are not reducible to description of behavior or output statistics; they presuppose a subject that can be held to standards.
Holding-to-standards presupposes the possibility of:
withholding (suspension),
judging under a criterion (evaluation),
binding oneself (commitment).
Therefore, the freedom-structure is a condition of possibility for reason-as-normativity.
This is a transcendental claim: it states what must be the case for reason to be intelligible as reason, not merely as a causal process.

5. Minimal definitions (operational)
These definitions are intentionally minimal, to make the core auditable.

Automatic continuation: any transition that occurs without a genuine possibility of withholding in the relevant context.
Suspension (genuine): a withholding that is not merely a different automatic path; it is the opening of a normative question (“should I?”).
Criterion: a standard that can be invoked in justification (even if contestable).
Commitment (normative signature): a state that makes the subject answerable (liable to demands for justification, revision, apology, repair).
6. Consequences (what follows if the thesis is correct)
Reason is not merely computation; it is computation plus normative signature.
Any account of intelligence that ignores imputable commitment fails to capture reason in the strict sense.
Externalization has a principled boundary:
many operations are externalizable (search, enumeration, simulation),
but the normative signature (commitment) is not externalizable without loss of agency.
7. Conditions of defeat (what would force revision)
This repository is committed to specifying what would count as a genuine refutation.

The thesis would require revision if one could show non-metaphorically that:

normative commitment (signature) can exist without suspension,
evaluation under a criterion can be fully accounted for without any subject capable of being held to it,
imputability can be reduced to purely descriptive/casual facts without remainder.
In short: if normativity-as-imputability can be grounded without the three-moment freedom-structure, the thesis fails.

8. Tests (conceptual, v0.1)
These are not empirical benchmarks; they are conceptual probes.

T1 — Withholding test
Can the purported reasoner withhold a conclusion in the face of strong output pressure, specifically because it recognizes a normative question (“not yet justified”)?

T2 — Criterion articulation test
Can the purported reasoner cite a criterion as such (not merely restate correlations), and allow that the criterion could be challenged?

T3 — Signature test
If the conclusion is wrong or harmful, is there a non-metaphorical subject who can be asked to justify, repair, retract, or apologize as the author of the commitment?

(These tests will be expanded and formalized in TESTS.md and INVARIANTS.md.)

9. Relation to AI (non-empirical)
This thesis does not depend on current AI limitations.
Even if systems become extremely capable, the question remains: are they sources of normativity (self-binding, imputable commitment), or are they instruments operating under normativity assigned from outside?

This repository defends the view that reason (strict) entails freedom (as normative signature), and that freedom is not a performance profile.

10. Next steps (for v0.2)
Expand the argument map (ARGUMENT_MAP.md) into numbered premises with explicit dependency on definitions.
Populate a minimal master glossary (10–20 terms) with usage conditions and counterexamples.
Write 10 steelman objections in OBJECTIONS.md and corresponding replies in RESPONSES.md.
Extract 5 invariants in INVARIANTS.md and 6–12 tests in TESTS.md.
