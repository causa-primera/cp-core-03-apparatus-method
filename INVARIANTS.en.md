# cp-core-03 — Invariants (v0.1.0)

These invariants constrain any apparatus that claims to preserve strong agency and normative responsibility under automation.

## I1 — Non-delegability of commitment
A normative commitment (K) must be attributable to a responsible subject. Instrumental systems may propose, but cannot “sign.”

## I2 — Genuine suspension must remain possible
The apparatus must preserve a real option to withhold (S): no forced, default, or silent continuation where commitment is implied.

## I3 — Decision-boundary legibility
For any commitment, the apparatus must make the decision boundary legible: what was decided, what alternatives existed, and what constraints applied.

## I4 — Criteria traceability (minimum viable reasons)
The apparatus must record the operative criteria used in evaluation (E) at a level sufficient for structured challenge and revision.
This is a requirement on the responsible subject’s stance, not on full model transparency.

## I5 — Answerability channel
There must exist a defined channel by which objections can trigger:
- re-opening suspension,
- re-evaluation under updated criteria,
- or explicit reaffirmation with updated justification.

## I6 — No silent substitution
The apparatus must prevent “Second Cause substitution”: instrumental outputs cannot be treated as if they were First-Cause commitments without an explicit PoS step.
